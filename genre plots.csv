History,"The Celtic tribes turned from traders into professional warriors, mercenaries and conquerors, spreading over most of Europe and even Galatia, in Asia Minor. That was one of the first parts to fall to the rising Mediterranean power, rebuilt Rome, which unlike the Celts was the very model of unified order, which quickly subjugated Iberia and southern France, yet gave the heartland Gaul the dived and rule treatment, allying itself with the strategic Aedui tribe in Burgundy. Their culture and military technology were far from the naked savages depicted by Time, as shown by the La Tène finds near lake Geneva, which also proves their dark, bloodily cruel side. Firstmost Roman general Julius Caesar won his greatest fame by conquering Gaul, despite it being united in defense by equally gifted warrior-king Vercingetorix. His vast army expected to hold out in its hill citadel of Alesia. Caeser laid a massive siege and built an equally impressive outward defense ring before Celtic reinforcements arrived, then made the difference with his last reserve legion when a break-trough from both sides was about to happen and ruthlessly smashed his adversary for good, slaying a million Gauls, selling another into slavery and taming the last third forever."
